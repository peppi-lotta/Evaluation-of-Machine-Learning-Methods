    "I have a task for you that concerns drug molecules and their targets. I have spent a lot of time in a laboratory to measure how strongly potential drug molecules bind to putative target molecules. I do not have enough resources to measure all possible drug-target pairs, so I would like to first predict their affinities and then measure only the most promising ones. I have already managed to create a model which I believe is good for this purpose. Its details are below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- algorithm: K-nearest neighbours regressor\n",
    "- parameters: K=20\n",
    "- training data: full data set\n",
    "\n",
    "The full data set is available as the files `input.data`, `output.data` and `pairs.data` for you to use. The first file contains the features of pairs, whereas the second contains their affinities. The third file contains the identifiers of the drug and target molecules of which the pairs are composed. The files are paired, i.e. the i<sup>*th*</sup> row in each file is about the same pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not able to evaluate how well my model will perform when I will use it to predict the affinities of new drug-target pairs. I need you to evaluate the model for me. There are three distinct situations in which I want to use this model in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I did not have the resources to measure the affinities of all the known drug-target pairs in the laboratory, so I want to use the model to predict the affinities of the remaining pairs.\n",
    "2. I am confident that I will discover new potential drug molecules in the future, so I will want to use the model to predict their affinities to the currently known targets.\n",
    "3. Because new putative target molecules, too, will likely be identified in the future, I will also want to use the model to predict the affinities between the drug molecules I will discover and the target molecules somebody else will discover in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "I need to get evaluation results from leave-one-out cross-validation with C-index. Please evaluate the generalisation performance of my model in the three situations and explain why your cross-validation methods are suitable for them.\n",
